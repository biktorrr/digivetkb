# digivetkb
DigiVet is a diagnostic system that heavily relies on an underlying knowledge-based system, and on semantic information transfer between village farmers and veterinarians at large physical distances. Digivet is built on the Kasadaka (kasadaka.com) platform. This platform contains the ClioPatria triple store (http://cliopatria.swi-prolog.org).  

This repository contains the raw XML represtation of the original non-semantic DigiVet application. It also contains the RDF files that make up the new DigiVet application. This contains the knowledge base and data necessary for the diagnistic system (rdf/data.ttl) as well as generated patient data (rdf/patients.ttl).
